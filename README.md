# Bayesian inference of the cosmical expansion constants


## Overview

This notebook was a deliverable required at the course of Data Analysis of Astrophysics, the goal of which was to implement Markov Chain Monte Carlo Techniques, specifically the Metropolis algorithm, to estimate the constants of the Hubble-Lemaitre law, which explains how the universe expands given a redshift value.
